# Warnings

When you create an app release, you will get 2 warning messages regarding deobfuscation and native code, but don't worry, they are just warning messages which can be safely ignored.

The first warning about deobfuscation appears because our project does not use the obfuscation method with proguard, but that doesn't matter, your code and information data will remain safe because they are protected with the url encryption method.

The second caveat about native code arises because some library implementations use native C# code in their coding, it is common practice and will not impact app performance.

So, in conclusion you don't need to worry, the warning message can be safely ignored and you can publish your app to Google Play safely.
